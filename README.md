A project created for presentation at the end of 4geeks' Data Science and Machine Learning cohort Miami-ds-10

This project does the following:

1. Scrapes the US Courts website for information about judicial vacancies
2. Builds a machine learning model to predict the likely time estimate until a nomination is confirmed for a judicial vacancy
3. Builds a Streamlit webapp with which users can obtain estimates given their inputs (e.g. the type of vacancy, the court, the circuit, etc.) for an existing or hypothetical vacancy.

## Tests

## ðŸ”Œ Test Fixtures: Judicial Vacancy Pages

Some of this project's test cases uses locally-downloaded copies of real HTML pages from [uscourts.gov](https://www.uscourts.gov/data-news/judicial-vacancies/archive-judicial-vacancies) as test fixtures to validate data-scraping behavior.

### ðŸ§ª Fixture Location

Fixture files are saved in:

```
tests/fixtures/pages
```

These are used by the test suite for deterministic, offline testing.

### ðŸš« Not Version Controlled

Due to their size (~371MB total), these files are **not committed to Git**. If cloning the repository fresh and wanting to run tests, youâ€™ll need to regenerate them.

### ðŸ“¥ Regenerate Fixtures

To re-download all year/month-level HTML files:

```bash
python tests/fixtures/download_fixture_pages.py
```

This will populate tests/fixtures/pages/ with HTML documents across the full range of years.

### Running tests

make test

## Set up Python environment

make create_environment
make requirements

## Run ruff (code formatter) for linting or reformatting

make lint
make format

## Retrieving data

make data

### Notebook Naming Convention

This project borrows from <https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/using-the-template/> a consistent naming pattern for Jupyter notebooks to maintain organization and clarity:

```
<PHASE>.<SEQUENCE>-<INITIALS>-<DESCRIPTION>.ipynb
```

- **PHASE**: Number indicating the development phase
  - `0` - Data exploration - often just for exploratory work
  - `1` - Data cleaning and feature creation - often writes data to data/processed or data/interim
  - `2` - Visualizations - often writes publication-ready viz to reports
  - `3` - Modeling - training machine learning models
  - `4` - Publication/Reporting - Notebooks that get turned directly into reports
- **SEQUENCE**: Two-digit number for ordering notebooks within the same phase
- **INITIALS**: Your initials (lowercase)
- **DESCRIPTION**: Short hyphen-separated description of the notebook's purpose

Example: `0.01-pjb-data-source-1.ipynb`

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Future improvement opportunities

- Include handling of future vacancies.  It is plausible that a vacancy which has been announced in advance (e.g. a retirement) could be filled more quickly than one which occurred due to a sudden vacancy (e.g. a death).  Handling the "future vacancy list" properly would require deciding how to handle vacancies whose vacancy date is "TBD" (there are multiple such instances on [Future Judicial Vacancies for December 2018](https://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/future-judicial-vacancies-december-2018)), and because the one thing all other vacancies have is a date on which they occurred, this is a non-trivial question.
