    "- 0 - Data exploration - often just for exploratory work\n",
    "- 1 - Data cleaning and feature creation - often writes data to data/processed or data/interim\n",
    "- 2 - Visualizations - often writes publication-ready viz to reports\n",
    "- 3 - Modeling - training machine learning models\n",
    "- 4 - Publication - Notebooks that get turned directly into reports\n",
    "- pjb - Your initials; this is helpful for knowing who created the notebook and prevents collisions from people working in the same notebook.\n",
    "- data-source-1 - A description of what the notebook covers\n",
    "Now that you have your notebook going, start your analysis!"
